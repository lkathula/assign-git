• What does fast-forward in git mean?
Answer: Fast-forward is way of merging in git. Lets say we have a main branch with 3 commits which means the main branch is pointing to 3rd commit(c3). Now we create a feature branch and do a commit(fourth commit- c4). In fast-forward merging, all git has to do is change the master branch pointer from c3 to c4. This process of merging is fast-forward.
